## Overview

Plant diseases can cause significant losses in agricultural productivity if not identified and treated early. This project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to classify plant diseases based on leaf images. By providing accurate predictions, it aims to aid in timely intervention and treatment.

The project is implemented primarily in **Jupyter Notebook** and includes image preprocessing, data augmentation, and model training/evaluation pipelines. It is designed to be user-friendly and can be extended with new datasets or models.

## Features

- **Disease Classification**: Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for accurate disease recognition.
- **Data Augmentation**: Implements techniques to handle image data variability.
- **Pretrained Models**: Option to use pretrained models like ResNet, VGG, etc., for transfer learning.
- **Customizable**: Easy to integrate with additional datasets and models.
- **Visualization**: Generates visualization of model performance and predictions.

## Technologies Used

The project is developed using the following tools and libraries:

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For code execution and visualization.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Framework for building deep learning models.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of healthy and diseased plant leaves. It is publicly available and can be downloaded from the following link:

[Plant Disease Dataset](<INSERT-DATASET-LINK-HERE>)

The dataset includes images of various plant species with different types of diseases.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ketan-33/PlantDiseaseClassification.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd PlantDiseaseClassification
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

> **Note**: Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in the repository to explore and run the code:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Follow the instructions in the notebooks to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The trained model achieves high accuracy in classifying plant diseases. Below are some highlights:

- **Accuracy**: Achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualized the model's classification performance.
- **Sample Predictions**: Displayed correct and incorrect predictions with visual explanations.

> Replace `XX%` with the actual accuracy once the model is trained.
